**Floating Wall** is a lightweight, privacy-focused Android utility that bypasses OEM hardware limitations by mapping a floating on-screen button to powerful system actions using a custom multi-tap engine.

## 🚀 The Problem It Solves
**This app is made for the person who had damaged their volume buttons**
**User can trigger volume, screenshots from Floating button.**
**Floating Wall** bypasses this by hijacking the native Android Accessibility button and injecting a custom time-delay engine to allow for 1-tap, 2-tap, and 3-tap physical macros—all without requiring Root access.

## ✨ Features
* **Multi-Tap Engine:** Configure different system actions for single, double, and triple taps.
* **Zero Battery Drain:** Built on an Event-Driven Architecture. The app sleeps entirely in the background until the physical button is pressed.
* **Snappy Haptics:** Millisecond-perfect vibration feedback creates the illusion of a tactile, physical button.
* **Premium UI:** iOS-style dark mode aesthetic with rounded cards and native dropdowns.
* **Privacy First:** Operates 100% locally. No internet permission required. No data collection.

## 🛠️ Current Supported Actions
* Force Open Volume Panel (without changing volume)
* Take Screenshot
* *(More actions coming soon)*
